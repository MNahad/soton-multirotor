Code for 2nd year multirotor UAV project at University of Southampton

## Task
The task is to design a multirotor UAV that can perform the following tasks:

+ _Autonomously fly to a height of 1.0 m and drop a payload._
+ _Autonomously fly to a height of 1.0 m and a distance of 1.0 m each from two target horizontal points_ (i.e. position (1, 1, 1)) _and drop a payload_.
+ _Be able to switch seamlessly between remote-pilot manual control and autonomous control at any point, and as many times as needed, during the mission._

The design has to be sub-700g, necessitating the use of some extreme hardware and electronics choices.

The UAV learns from the pilot during any manual control, by sensing the pilot inputs and adjusting parameters. A state machine runs the high-level control using a set of global vars and interrupts. Important data is sent via Bluetooth to a laptop a la Flight Data Recorder.

The design can be seen below:
